Verse 1:
            </center> </h2>
          <h3 style='color:white'>
          Why is it every move I make turns out to be a bad one?
Where's my guardian angel? Need one, wish I had one
I'm right here, shorty, and I'ma hold you down
You trying to fuck all these bitches? I'ma show you how
But who-? (Name's D, like you, but my friends call me Damien)
And I'ma put you hip to something (uh-huh) about this game we in
You and me could take it there, and you'll be
The hottest nigga ever living (that's a given?) You'll see
Hmm, that's what I've been wanting all my life
Thinkin' about my little man, so I call my wife
Well, your dada is about to make it happen
(What you mean, my nigga?) I'm about to make it rapping
Today I met this cat, he said his name was Damien
He thinks that we're a lot alike and wants to be my friend
(You mean like Chuckie?) Ha ha, yeah, just like Chuckie
(Dada, looks like we both lucky) Yeah

  <h3 style='color:white'>
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see him if you living in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see him if you living in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see him if you living in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gon' see him if you living in the fog?

           <h3 style='color:white'>
          Ay-yo, D (What up, D?) You's a smooth nigga
I seen you when nobody knew who pulled the trigger
Yeah, you know, it's always over dough
You sure? I could have swore it was over a hoe
Nah, nah, that ain't my style (igga, you stay fronting)
But you're still my man, and I ain't gonna say nothin'
Got some weed? Go 'head, smoke it (what?) Go 'head, drink it (what?)
Go 'head and fuck shorty, you know I can keep a secret (aight)
I'm about to have you driving, probably a Benz
But we gotta stay friends, blood out, blood in
Sounds good to me, fuck it, what I got to lose?
Hmm, nothin' I can think of, any nigga would choose
Got me pushing the whips, takin' trips across seas
Pockets stay laced, nigga, I floss Gs
For that nigga I would bleed, give him my right hand
Now that I think about it, yo, that's my man!

  </center></h2>
           <h3 style='color:white'>
          You like how everything is going? You like what I gave ya?
You know if you was going down, I'd be the one to save ya
But yo, I need a favor, these cats across town hate me
Plus their behavior hasn't been too good lately
What? Anything for you, dog, where them niggas at?
38th from Broadway (aight, let me get the gat)
Run up on 'em strapped, bust off caps in four niggas
Laid low for 'bout a month then killed two more niggas
Now I'm ready to chill, but you still want me to kill
Look at what I did for you! Dog, come on, keep it real!
Aight, fuck it, I'ma do it, who is it this time?
Ayy-yo, remember that kid Sean you used to be with in '89?
Nah, that's my man! (I thought I was your man?)
But yo, that's my nigga (hey, who's your biggest fan?)
Either do it or give me your right hand, that's what you said
I see now, it ain't nothing but trouble ahead (uh-huh)
