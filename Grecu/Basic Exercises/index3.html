    <h1>Let It Go</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>
            Not a footprint to be seen<br>
            A kingdom of isolation<br>
            And it looks like I'm the queen</p>
        
        <p>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>
            Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried<br>
            Don't let them in, don't let them see<br>
            Be the good girl you always have to be<br>
            Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know<br>
            Well, now they know</p>
        
        <p>Let it go, let it go,
            <span>can't hold it back anymore</span><br>
            Let it go, let it go,
            <span>turn away and slam the door</span><br>
            I don't care what they're going to say<br>
            Let the storm rage on<br>
            The cold never bothered me anyway</p>
    </div>
    <span>It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
        And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
        <div>It's time to see what I can do
            To test the limits and break through
        </div>
        No right, no wrong, no rules for me
        I'm free
    </span>
